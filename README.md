# Algorithms
 In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm is a sequence of instructions, 
 typically to solve a class of problems or perform a computation. 
 Algorithms are unambiguous specifications for performing 
                calculation, 
                data processing, 
                automated reasoning, 
                and other tasks
